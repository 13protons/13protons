## Experience

### Detroit Labs
**Senior Frontend Developer, Jan 2016 – Present**
Detroit, MI

Detroit Labs is a mobile app development shop in downtown Detroit with dozens of clients you'd recognize (Jimmy Johns and Domino's pizza apps, for example). I work on site at General Motors with a mix of Detroit Labs developers, GM employees, and members of other staffing agencies. While there I've worked on in-vehicle apps, and was the lead developer for vehicle emulation software aimed at helping outside developers build for the latest generation of GM vehicles. I've worked in developer, lead developer, architect, and team-lead roles, while also getting experience hosting and participating in hackathons centered around the software I helped create.

While in this role I learned GM's proprietary app framework (NGI), built a cross platform desktop app with Electron, authored Node.js modules, and gained lost of experience with Mocha, Jasmine, Webpack, Angular 1.x, Vue.js and many other facets of the modern front-end stack.
