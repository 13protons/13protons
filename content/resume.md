    <h1>Alan Languirand</h1>
    <p>I'm a tech generalist with deep knowledge of front-end web development and a long list of adjacencies. I went to school thinking I would become a mechanical engineer, got an art degree instead, and then just ended up in software. I've been confusing myself and others with that blurry line ever since.</p>

I took on the role of technical co-founder for a new SaaS product, Farebox. Farebox is booking and scheduling software for buses, and provides all tools for running a charter bus business. 

I took on many types of jobs for this product, including visual designer, interaction designer, developer, product developer, writing help docs, customer service...you know, it's a startup! We produced a suite of tools for charter bus operators and run The Detroit Bus Company and others on the product. Farebox has been used to take and fulfill hundreds of reservations, coordinate dozens of vehicles and drivers, and has processed hundreds of thousands of dollars in customer payments.

## Rocket Companies

Design System Architect, Experience Director, Feb 2019 - April 2021 Detroit, MI

While at Rocket companies I had the role of Experience Director that sat in the middle of a large product management, creative, and development team all working toward building the next generation of a product known as Rocket Pro. 

Rocket Pro itself is a third part mortgage origination tool that makes the most powerful parts of the Quicken Loans technology stack and internal loan validation process available as a SaaS product available to select partners. Depending on the level of partnership it was possible for users to interact with two very different but related products, one geared more towards a "retail" partnership with the other fitting tightly into a traditional broker origination process. 

I worked with product and engineering leadership to focus the efforts of a creative team composed of designers, information architects, user testing professionals, and copywriters. Our work spanned a wide range of the products, and I was directly involved in taking the retail version of the Rocket Pro interface from a generation 1 prototype that shared lots of it's DNA with the consumer facing Rocket Mortgage stack to a second generation product tailored to enabling part time 3rd party origination. 

During he course this work I dealt with many of the usual SaaS suspects, such as design system integration, welcome experiences, customer support experiences, and listing complex resources. I also learned about the entire mortgage origination process and helped develop the interfaces that surface critical information about the enormous number of ways that any given loan could fail to satisfy an aspect of underwriting. 

This particular project and role was a departure for me from my usual tech focused role, and I learned a great teal more about user testing and validation, structured approached to market and user research, and product management.

Detroit Labs is a mobile app development shop in downtown Detroit with dozens of clients you’d recognize (Jimmy Johns and Domino’s pizza apps, for example).
