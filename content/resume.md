### Work History

## Future

<resume-meta>
  <template #role>Lead Developer</template>
  <template #duration>March 2022 - Present </template>
  <template #location>Detroit, MI & NYC</template>
</resume-meta>

I joined Future as a seasoned developer and product leader with absolutely no experience in the team's current tech stack. In what felt like no time I was up to speed on building Flutter apps for iOS and contributing to an app with some of the DNA from my last startup that I could have certainly used when I was starting out - tools for entreprenaurs to get paid for their work and keep their business separate from their personal finances. 

My focus has been on front-end mobile UI using Flutter. In addition to learning the tooling I brought my knowledge of accessibility, design, and workflow dynamics to help shape the product and make it usable by larger groups of people. While I was learning about `CustomScrollView`s, `GestureDetector`s and the finer points of conforming to parent constraints I also got a crash course in how to integrate name brand 3rd party development shops and high profile design agencies into the processing of building a dense app for a tiny startup. 

Future is currently in the app store but in private beta with big news due early 2023.

## Farebox

<resume-meta>
  <template #role>Technical Founder</template>
  <template #duration>April 2021 - March 2022 </template>
  <template #location>Detroit, MI</template>
</resume-meta>

I took on the role of technical co-founder for a new SaaS product, Farebox. Farebox is booking and scheduling software for buses, and provides all tools for running a charter bus business. 

Key technologies used for building Farebox include Node.js, Express, Vue.js, MongoDB, Redis, Stripe, Mapbox, Postmark, Twilio, Nuxt, and Particle IOT. During the course of development I learned about containerizing with Docker, testing with Cypress, CI and deploy with Heroku, and more.

I took on many types of jobs for this product, including visual designer, interaction designer, developer, product developer, writing help docs, customer service...you know, it's a startup! We produced a suite of tools for charter bus operators and run The Detroit Bus Company and others on the product. Farebox has been used to take and fulfill hundreds of reservations, coordinate dozens of vehicles and drivers, and has processed hundreds of thousands of dollars in customer payments.

## Rocket Companies

<resume-meta>
  <template #role>Experience Director</template>
  <template #duration>Feb 2019 - April 2021</template>
  <template #location>Detroit, MI</template>
</resume-meta>

While at Rocket companies I had the role of Experience Director. I sat in the middle of a large product management, creative, and development team all working toward building the next generation of a product known as Rocket Pro. 

Rocket Pro itself is a third party mortgage origination tool that makes the most powerful parts of the Quicken Loans technology stack and internal loan validation process available as a SaaS product to select partners. Depending on the level of partnership it was possible for users to interact with two very different but related products, one geared more towards a "retail" partnership with the other built for traditional third-pary mortgage brokers. 

I worked with product and engineering leadership to focus the efforts of a creative team composed of designers, information architects, user testing professionals, and copywriters. Our work spanned a wide range of the products, and I was directly involved in taking the retail version of the Rocket Pro interface from a generation one prototype that shared lots of it's DNA with the consumer facing Rocket Mortgage stack to a second generation product tailored to enabling retail partnership for 3rd party origination. 

During the course of this work I dealt with many of the usual SaaS suspects, such as design system integration, welcome experiences, customer support experiences, and listing complex resources. I also learned about the entire mortgage origination process and helped develop the interfaces that surface critical information about the enormous number of ways that any given loan could fail to satisfy an aspect of underwriting. 

This particular project and role was a departure for me from my usual tech focused role, and I learned a great teal more about user testing and validation, structured approached to market and user research, and product management.

## General Motors

<resume-meta>
  <template #role>Lead Developer</template>
  <template #duration>May 2017 – Feb 2019</template>
  <template #location>Detroit, MI</template>
</resume-meta>

I led a software team at General Motors focused on creating tools for developers building apps for GM’s in-vehicle infotainment system. My roles on this team included senior developer, lead architect, product owner, and dev team manager.

On that team I helped build and release two industry-first products - A desktop app for emulating the in-vehicle runtime context called the NGI Emulator, and an in-vehicle app which can turn virtually any production vehicle into a secure infotainment app testing platform called GM Dev Client.

I followed a contract-to-hire path to full time employment at GM, and my experience at Detroit Labs (below) was really the start of my time working in-vehicle apps and tools.

</resume-meta>

Detroit Labs is a mobile app development shop in downtown Detroit with dozens of clients you’d recognize (Jimmy Johns and Domino’s pizza apps, for example). I worked on-site in a contract/consultation role at General Motors with a mix of Detroit Labs developers, GM employees, and members of other staffing agencies. While there I’ve worked on in-vehicle apps, and was the lead developer for vehicle emulation software aimed at helping outside developers build for the latest generation of GM vehicles. I’ve worked in developer, lead developer, architect, and team-lead roles, while also getting experience hosting and participating in hackathons centered around the software I helped create.

While in this role I learned GM’s proprietary app framework (NGI), built a cross platform desktop app with Electron, authored Node.js modules, and gained lost of experience with Mocha, Jasmine, Webpack, Angular 1.x, Vue.js and many other facets of the modern front-end stack.
