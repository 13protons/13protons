I took on the role of product development and full-stack engineer for a new SaaS product, Farebox. Farebox is booking and scheduling software for buses, and provides all tools for running a charter bus business. 

Major aspects of Farebox include building complex schedules, managing user, customers and vehicles, creating robust quotes, and keeping track of dozens of important details through a charter booking's lifecycle from initial inquiry through to post-service survey. 

I brought my knowledge of front-end and server architecture, product development, design, component development and more to this project. During the course of development I learned quite a bit about what small businesses want out of fleets, and some of the finer points of building and selling SaaS. 

Other key features of Farebox include a deep integration with payment processing, GPS data processing, transactional email, and realtime SMS notifications. 

Major technologies used to build Farebox include banner projects like Node.js, Express, Vue.js, MongoDB, Redis, Stripe, Mapbox, Postmark, Twilio, Nuxt, and Particle IOT. During the course of development I learned about containerizing with Docker, testing with Cypress, CI and deploy with Heroku, and more.

My favorite parts of this project were always release announcements. Our design, build, test and release cycle was typically 1-2 weeks, and Farebox saw almost 150 releases in a 1 year+ of development. I created documentation for key aspects of the software to help users self serve, internal communication processes for surfacing and addressing blocking technical problems and downtime, and generally poured lots of energy in.
