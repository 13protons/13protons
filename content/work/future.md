I joined Future as a seasoned developer and product leader with absolutely no experience in the team's current tech stack. In what felt like no time I was up to speed on building Flutter apps for iOS and contributing to an app with some of the DNA from my last startup that I could have certainly used when I was starting out - tools for entreprenaurs to get paid for their work and keep their business separate from their personal finances. 

My focus has been on front-end mobile UI using Flutter. In addition to learning the tooling I brought my knowledge of accessibility, design, and workflow dynamics to help shape the product and make it usable by larger groups of people. While I was learning about `CustomScrollView`s, `GestureDetector`s and the finer points of conforming to parent constraints I also got a crash course in how to integrate name brand 3rd party development shops and high-profile design agencies into the process of building a dense app for a tiny startup. 

Future is currently in the app store but in private beta with big news due early 2023.
