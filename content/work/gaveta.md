Gaveta ("drawer" in Brazilian Portuguese) is an open-source and mobile-friendly drawer component built for Vue.js. It's a distinct UI component open sourced from Farebox and available on Github and NPM

Modern software development can fell like we add a mote of dust on top of a vast pile of open source projects that blazed the path for us. This was a small way to contribute to that vastness.

Besides the warm feelings, open sourcing this was a way to sharpen the knife in terms of copywriting, writing documentation, and simple publishing pipelines.

While the code for Gaveta is Vue and a tiny sprinkle of CSS, the component concepts such as slots, name spacing, module wrapping, animation lifecycles, customizability, CSS variables, and library targets (it works for Vue 2 AND 3 :) are applicable to many frameworks.
