While at Rocket companies I had the role of Experience Director that sat in the middle of a large product management, creative, and development team all working toward building the next generation of a product known as Rocket Pro. 

Rocket Pro itself is a third part mortgage origination tool that makes the most powerful parts of the Quicken Loans technology stack and internal loan validation process available as a SaaS product available to select partners. Depending on the level of partnership it was possible for users to interact with two very different but related products, one geared more towards a "retail" partnership with the other fitting tightly into a traditional broker origination process. 

I worked with product and engineering leadership to focus the efforts of a creative team composed of designers, information architects, user testing professionals, and copywriters. Our work spanned a wide range of the products, and I was directly involved in taking the retail version of the Rocket Pro interface from a generation 1 prototype that shared lots of it's DNA with the consumer facing Rocket Mortgage stack to a second generation product tailored to enabling part time 3rd party origination. 

During he course this work I dealt with many of the usual SaaS suspects, such as design system integration, welcome experiences, customer support experiences, and listing complex resources. I also learned about the entire mortgage origination process and helped develop the interfaces that surface critical information about the enormous number of ways that any given loan could fail to satisfy an aspect of underwriting. 

This particular project and role was a departure for me from my usual tech focused role, and I learned a great teal more about user testing and validation, structured approached to market and user research, and product management.
